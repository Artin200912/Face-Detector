# Face Detection Model with TensorFlow: A Custom Dataset Approach

This project showcases the development of a face detection model using TensorFlow, leveraging a custom dataset created from scratch. The dataset was annotated using Labelbox and augmented with Albumentations, ensuring a robust and varied training set for the model. This approach demonstrates how to build a tailored face detection system, catering to specific requirements or environments. The project also includes a comprehensive YouTube tutorial, guiding users through the entire process from dataset creation to model training and evaluation.

## Features

- **Custom Dataset Creation**: Utilizes Labelbox for annotation and Albumentations for data augmentation, resulting in a high-quality dataset for face detection.
- **Model Training**: Develops a face detection model using TensorFlow, tailored to the specific characteristics of the custom dataset.
- **YouTube Tutorial**: A step-by-step guide available on YouTube, covering the entire process from dataset preparation to model deployment.
